[b]What Does This Mod Add?[/b]
This mod doesn't add anything by itself, it simply sets up core infrastructure such as the research tab, base weapon definitions and other small pieces for my other weapons mods. 
This prevents those mods all having to add the same stuff, causing them to override each other, which can slow the game down on loading it up and cause errors in the log.

[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It will cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content). You can try destroying all the content added but I'd be worried existing addictions might cause problems with world pawns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- Combat Extended: Not Compatible (I don't play with this mod sorry, if my mod becomes popular enough, I'll write a patch or leave that to the CE team)

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
None at the moment.
